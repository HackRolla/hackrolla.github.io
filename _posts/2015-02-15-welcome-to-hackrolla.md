We're a group of people who are interested in making/fixing/hacking things. Right now, a lot of our interests focus on electronics, but I'd reckon that regardless of what you're interested in, you can probably find someone else here who's also interested in that thing. 

The point of HackRolla is to encourage people to work on projects, help other people out, share/lend/borrow tools and supplies, and provide a way to teach and learn new skills. Ultimately, it'd be cool to have enough members to be able to afford a space, but right now we're looking to build a community. 

So far, we have had a couple of meetups and one [class on laying out a PCB for a lab power supply](https://github.com/HackRolla/Information/wiki/Class-Lab-Power-Supply). 
Soon we will be holding a PCB soldering and assembly class where we will build the lab power supply we designed. 

We're also compiling a [list of parts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16GlLWy0XYy_WV5VWBPPRWohu3LPITLqgg4Bu3Xgo-nQ/edit?usp=sharing_eid) to build a parts library for projects people are working on.
